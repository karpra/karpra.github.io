Iâ€™m a Software tinkerer believing in building software thats simple , easy and adaptable.

I believe programming is an art that needs to be crafted beautifully , i see it sort of language between me & the computer. The idea behind this blog is to serve as means to document my findings/experiments or know how-to tales to my digital catalogue.

I am a software tinkerer @ heart with a decade+ years of experience in IT industry specializing in Middleware & Integration space.

I get my hands dirty in open source technologies with focussed interest in distributed   systems , devops, messaging , ui frameworks with varied interest in different platforms.

I am have been wanting to start a blog for a long time , but i have not been able to convince that i am good enough to write , but after much comtemplation i have decided to write all things that i do not get to use in professional life.
 
I'm hoping to be able to contribute to open source technologies in any form or shape.

 I am an IT Consultant with a decade+ experience in Middleware & Integration
 space in the java/j2ee space.

 A software tinker at heart who gets his hands dirty in open source technologies 
 with focussed interest in distributed systems , big data, devops, messaging , ui frameworks.
 I am have been wanting to start a blog for a long time , but i have not been able to 
 convince that i am good enough to write , but after much comtemplation i have decided to write
 all things that i do not get to use in professional life.
 
 I'm hoping to be able to contribute to open source technologies in any form or 
 shape.

Iâ€™m a Software tinkerer believing in building software thats simple , easy and adaptable.

Programming is an art that needs to be crafted beautifully , i see it sort of language between me & the computers.

Unsettling nature of my mind is always curious & experimenting with new technology , which by the way is an absolute joy.

The idea behind this blog is to document my experiments , help me solve certain problem & learn new things along the way.

This serves as a mean to document my findings/experiment or how-to tales to my digital catalogue.

Above all its my occupation , its what i live , breathe everyday @ work.

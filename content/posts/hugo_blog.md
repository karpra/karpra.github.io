**Warning!** This post is still lame will update soon.

After much procrastination i have moved the previous blog running in jekyll to hugo.
I will document the steps I took to move the content to diff blog engine , but predominately used the git branch strategy to host static pages using hugo framework and migrating my content from jekyll to here.

Introduction

Nginx is one of the most popular web servers in the world and is responsible for hosting some of the largest and highest-traffic sites on the internet. It is more resource-friendly than Apache in most cases and can be used as a web server or a reverse proxy.

Install

I have provisioned a ubuntu box using vagrant and i will go over details of installation of nginx in the provisioned ubuntu linux.

  Pre-requisties
  Vagrant

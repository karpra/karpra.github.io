I have been contemplating for a while to start blogging primary to write things that i have learnt and processed 
over time & be able to write it for reference at some point of time.

I was experimenting with blogger , wordpress , tumblr etc but never got traction or it just lacked that appeal 
for me to lure me into the idea of blogging.

The minute i got to know about blogging using gitpages i got interested primary it was very simple to publish a 
blog , yet it was  simple and minimilistic. Though assuming i am not going to write anything fabulous here than
merely adding to digital footprint, but i thought it was worth mentioning my experiences for me to look as reference.

Finally after crazy experiments in other blogging sites github pages kind of pulled me into blogging coz i was able
to configure my blog , code my post in my blog away like i was coding than mere writing.

what is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through Markdown (or Textile) and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.

Please refer to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) website.

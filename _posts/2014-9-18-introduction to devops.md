Whats is Devops?

Development & Operations teams forging together is devops. When i say that let me explain the typical
lifecyle activities of development team and operations team in getting any solution or application 
up & running available for the business to start using internally or externally (enterprise,b2b,b2c or consumer market).

Business typically are sponsors of any application or solution developed using a given platform ( eg : -python,php,java 
or .net etc) to solve a given business problem. Now comes project inception & companies bring in different set of teams
who for practical purposes have worked as seperate business unit within same organization who come together to solve 
a combined task towards a result oriented goal.

Development team starts developing the application which goes through typical SDLC process from Business Requirement
defining the functional requirement of the application which believe it or not is always constantly changing business
constantly pushes the changes & change management is unavoidable and this it not something new. Operations team are responsible to deliver a infrastructure for the application to be hosted and running in an stable environment for maximum uptime , throughput & performance defined by the SLA requirements of the application.

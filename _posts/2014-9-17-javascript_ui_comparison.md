This is a page dedeicated to analysis of different javascript MVC or MVVC frameworks on top of JQuery.

I have been relectant for a long time to jump into javascript layer , simply i was either not good at it or i did not
have expertise to build applications as quickly as i would have with java frameworks.

The main driving factor for me to move to this direction was to have a lightweight ui layer & also be able to build
Single Page Application ( SPA ) let me term to do some activity critical to automate some of my work.

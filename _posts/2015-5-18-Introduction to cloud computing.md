# What is Cloud Computing?
The concept of cloud computing has existed for 50 years, since the beginning of the Internet.It was devised the idea of time-sharing in computers as a utility in 1957.Since then, the concept’s name has undergone several changes: from service bureau, to application service provider, to the Internet as a service, to cloud computing, and to software-defined datacenters, with each name having different nuances. However, the core concept is the same: providing IT services based on the Internet (the cloud).

# Key Attributes of Cloud Computing

# Models of Cloud Computing ?
+ *IaaS*
Infrastucture as a Service(IaaS) virtualizes the data centers’ computing power, storage, and network connectivity. Users can scale these computing resources up and down on demand dynamically and/or based on a given set of rules upon which action would be taken by the cloud engine.

+ *PaaS*
Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides a development platform with services to assist application design, implementation, testing, deploy­ment, monitoring, and hosting in the cloud. It requires no software download or installation and supports geographi­cally distributed collaborative work.
+ *SaaS*
 Software as a Service(SaaS) includes both software components (for application developers) and applications (for users). An SaaS application is often a service-oriented program so that it is easy to integrate with other SaaS applications.Software that performs various tasks is not on the client machine. Instead, third-party service providers host and manage the software services in the cloud.

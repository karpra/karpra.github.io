This is a comparison of multiple javascript ui libraries available.

The list of Javascript framework i am going to compare are below & the reasoning why these were choosen is based on the 
possibilities of extending JQuery library and formulating a governance for data exchange between the controller and model ( data)
layer.

1. Angular JS
2. Agility JS
3. Backbone JS
4. Embed JS

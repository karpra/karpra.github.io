I have been contemplating for a while to start blogging primary to write things that i have learnt and processed 
over time & be able to write it for reference at some point of time.

I was experimenting with blogger , wordpress , tumblr etc but never got traction or it just lacked that appeal 
for me to lure me into the idea of blogging.

The minute i got to know about blogging using gitpages i got interested primary it was very simple to publish a 
blog , yet it was  simple and minimilistic. Though assuming i am not going to write anything fabulous here than
merely adding to digital footprint, but i thought it was worth mentioning my experiences for me to look as reference.

Finally after crazy experiments in other blogging sites github pages kind of pulled me into blogging coz i was able
to configure my blog , code things in my blog using a templating engine called jekyll.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

`function(startBlogging){
  return list.posts;
}`

I will go ahead explain about blogging setup i did for jekyll and github pages is powered by jekyll behind the scene.

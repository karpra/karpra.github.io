I have been contemplating for a while to start blogging primary to write things that i have learnt and processed 
over time & be able to write it for reference at some point of time.

I was experimenting with blogger , wordpress , tumblr etc but never got traction or it just lacked that appeal 
for me to lure me into the idea of blogging.

The minute i got to know about blogging using gitpages i got interested primary it was very simple to publish a 
blog , yet it was  simple and minimilistic. Though assuming i am not going to write anything fabulous here than
merely adding to digital footprint, but i thought it was worth mentioning my experiences for me to look as reference.

Finally after crazy experiments in other blogging sites github pages kind of pulled me into blogging coz i was able
to configure my blog , code my blog using a templating engine called jekyll.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) uses a template engine to blog the posts from text to html using either Markdown or textile.
Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

Use the `printf()` function.

I will go ahead explain about blogging setup i did for jekyll and github pages is powered by jekyll behind the scene.
